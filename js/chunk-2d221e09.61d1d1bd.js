MAT is the use of medications in conjunction with behavioral therapy as part of a long-term treatment regimen. There are three main MAT medications used today—methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Research has shown MAT, in particular the use of methadone or buprenorphine, is considered an evidence-based practice to treat OUD. Studies indicate those in MAT have better outcomes than those who engage in therapy alone. This article provides an overview of MAT with a focus on use with criminal justice populations.",showTeaser:!1},{title:"Juvenile Justice in Illinois, 2015",splash:"/assets/img/articles/fence_behind_bars_juvenile.jpg",authors:["Lily Gleicher"],pubtype:["Article"],area:["Juvenile Justice","Juveniles"],date:"2017-07-12",filename:"juvenile-justice-in-illinois-2015",teaser:"<p><em>Juvenile Justice in Illinois, 2015,</em> provides a statistical overview of the juvenile justice system in Illinois across four decision points in which data were available: arrest, detention admissions, active probation caseloads, and new sentence admissions to corrections.
